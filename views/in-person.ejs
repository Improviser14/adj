              <p>At ADJ Driver Improvement Center in Woodbridge, Virginia, we try to make your Driver Improvement
                Clinic experience as easy as possible. All Driver Improvement Clinics are $65.00, regardless of the
                format you choose. We are one of the few schools that have a dedicated office with multiple classrooms,
                therefore we never have to cancel our classes. If you find that you need a class last minute or maybe
                you have just procrastinated…… Come on in, walk-ins are always welcome!</p>
              <p>In-Person Classes: We offer in-person Driver Improvement Clinics as one-day classes, on Saturday or
                Sunday. We also offer a full eight hour class during the week on a Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Saturday or Sunday Classes: We offer Driver Improvement classes every Saturday and every other Sunday.
                These classes are one-day classes, they begin at 8:30 a.m. and finish at 5:00 p.m. All components of
                the class, including the final exam and certificate are handled in- house, same day. When you leave our
                class, you have everything you need, in-hand.</p>
              <p>Wednesday Classes: We offer Driver Improvement Classes on Wednesdays, twice each month. These classes

                components of this class including the final exam and certificate are handled in-house.</p>

              <p>The Virginia Driver Improvement Clinic is a program that will award you 5 safe driving points upon
                completion. You may also participate in a class under the advisement of a judge, to reduce or dismiss a
                ticket. You may need to complete a class if any of the reasons below apply:</p>
              <p>DMV:

                or Defensive Driving Class at an approved driving school within 90 days or your license will be
                suspended. Completion and submission of the class from an approved driving school before your due date
                ensures uninterrupted driving privileges and relieves you from paying the $175.00 re-instatement fee.

                or for insurance requirements. You are eligible to voluntarily take the class every two years.
                On your own or with legal advisement you have decided to take a Driver Improvement Class before or
                after a court appearance.</p>
